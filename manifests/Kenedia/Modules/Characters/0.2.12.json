  "description": "A tool to easily switch characters even with a lot of them!\nDISCLAIMER: Guild Wars 2 has randomly issues with sorting your characters if you log into them only for a short time. This will mess with this module, there is nothing that can be done about it sadly. Once the API updates the character list they will get sorted again!",
